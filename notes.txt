I do want to use SQL with this project. Practice with this tool that I have less experience with.

So, I need to pull data into python then put into SQL

I think the git integration should be as follows:
I should pull all of the data with python & store it as csv files
& I should include the scripts I use to throw it into SQL
So, I will use & practice with a local SQL database & provide all the scripts to create said database

So, there should be a unified script to create the entire database in a single script run

Options:
Single unified script to create database
&
Add any singular data pull


### Data Analysis

Outside of the data pulls & storage I want to visualize the data
Could do in both python & leaflet
Also want to do some sort of data analysis over time stuff

So, I would need to create notebooks where I pull data in from mysql server, manipulate & produce reports
